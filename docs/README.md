## Documentation Standards

### Structure

Each guide should include:
- Clear title and description
- Table of contents (for longer docs)
- Prerequisites section
- Step-by-step instructions with code examples
- Troubleshooting section (where relevant)
- Additional resources/links

### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for code blocks:

```bash
# Bash commands
npm install
```

```typescript
// TypeScript code
const app = new Elysia()
```

### Best Practices

- Use clear, simple language
- Provide context before commands
- Include expected output when helpful
- Add warnings for destructive operations
- Cross-reference related documentation
- Keep content up-to-date
